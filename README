INSTALL

1. Install Leingingen https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
  -- Leingingen is like Clojure's version of RVM.

2. Fire up the sinatra app to serve the HTML file:
  * cd ruby
  * ruby sinatra.rb

Now you should have an HTML file being served at http://localhost:4567/

3. Fire up clojure to :
  * lein repl

; In the REPL command line:

  (require 'hello.core)

Now, you should have a WebSocket server on port 9000.

4. Point your browser to http://localhost:4567/

This should work on Chrome, Safari and Firefox.  I haven't tested it on
IE 9, yet.


Enjoy.
