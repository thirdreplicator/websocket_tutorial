INSTALL

1. Install Leingingen https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
  -- Leingingen is like Clojure's version of RVM.

2. Fire up clojure to :
  * lein deps
  * lein compile
  * lein repl

; In the REPL command line:

  (require 'chat.core)

Now, you should have a WebSocket server on port 9000.

3. Point your browser to index.html

This should work on Chrome 20+, Safari 5+ and Firefox 13+.
It doesn't work on IE 9.


Enjoy.
